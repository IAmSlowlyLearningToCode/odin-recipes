# The Odin Project: Recipes Website
(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)

## Project: 
- Create a website with a main page linking 3 other pages for recipes
- 3 other recipe pages should inlcude basic html styling and relevant images

## Learning goals: 
- Review plain html website building
- Learn git workflow
- Learn to create good commits
- Get used to tracking project in repository

## What I learned:
- Projects are much harder in practice! While the steps themselves were relatively simple, I still felt the difference between the idea of something and actually doing it.
- Commits are hard! This was the hardest part of the project for me. I still don't feel sure what to put into a single commit, or what level of detail is necessary to describe it. 
- Other than figuring out what to commit, the git workflow was nice. It was rewarding to build up progress and then send it to my repository. 
- It wasn't pretty, but I was surprised how much I could build with basic html elements.
